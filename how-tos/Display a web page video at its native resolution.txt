Why is a web page <video> (e.g. YouTube) resized, e.g. a 640x480 video resized 1440x1080 on your display?
<video> has a container (like width=100%) & by default it's video{object-fit:contain} of the user agent stylesheet of Falkon, or a web browser in general, but the very default (if nothing about video in the user agent stylesheet) is video{object-fit:fill} https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_object-fit.asp .

Obviously the author of the web page can override the user agent stylesheet, e.g. on YouTube there's <video>, class, html5-main-video that points to a CSS rule containing object-fit:cover.

• The solution: an user stylesheet

•• <video> not fitted to its container

Falkon, Preferences, Other, User Style Sheet, select a .css file containing:
⃝
video{object-fit:none!important}
⏺
Or

•• <video> without container

As above
⃝
video{width:auto!important
height:auto!important}
⏺

1st vs 2nd:
E.g. on YouTube: <video> not fitted to its container is centered to the player, without container is upper left.

• An other solution

Change video{object-fit:contain} of the user agent stylesheet of Falkon to video{object-fit:none!important} or other, by modifying Falkon or its source code https://github.com/KDE/falkon , I know not where...
